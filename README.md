### H3 Building a website from scratch was challenging but I enjoyed it when the site was launched with a good user experience as well as functioning. The process covered three main areas:

1. I started the design from a sketch, a low-fidelity digital wireframe, transformed it into a high-fidelity prototype, and tested the user experience by using Adobe XD.

2. Once the overall web design is satisfied, I start using visual studio code with HTML coding and start using CSS for styling. Mobile first was the approach we used and bootstrap was helpful in the project. While bootstrap could be a challenging tool to use, it is because bootstrap is a very new learned knowledge for us and it takes time for me to digest and try out. Thank you to the lab class and I had a chance to ask the teacher for the navigation bar styling. While I also tried to use an open source .php file to launch the contact form. However, it seems that there are some issues and I couldn't figure it out so I changed back to using a basic mail to function on a button for sending me messages instead.

3. Testing was the last stage when I worked on the project to ensure all the experiences worked well and the content fits all devices. 

### H3 What did I learn?

To complete the project in a timely manner, it needs to be well organized on the timing, the structure of the website, know the objectives, content, images, logo, target audience, and much more. I have learned a lot from the process, from logo design to device mockup, from basic html to using bootstrap. Learned both technical skills and soft skills. Learned to be flexible (while the .php was not working).
